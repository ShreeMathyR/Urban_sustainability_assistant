## 📁 Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Urban upgrade.py` | Simulates urban issue detection using AI, integrates basic IoT data, and logs civic feedback securely using a blockchain-like mechanism. |
| `Final release for urban monitoring.py` | Implements a full pipeline: data classification, zoning recommendations, system diagrams, and dashboard visualization with classification metrics. |
| `build the future of urban intelligence.py` | A Jupyter notebook UI demo using `ipywidgets` that allows interaction with AI analysis, IoT simulation, and feedback submission in a more user-friendly format. |

## 🔍 Features

### ✅ AI Urban Issue Detection
- Identifies key urban challenges such as:
  - Informal Settlements
  - Traffic Congestion
  - Infrastructure Deficiencies
- Provides actionable planning suggestions using a simulated AI model.

### 📡 IoT Sensor Integration
- Real-time simulation of:
  - Air Quality Index
  - Noise Levels
  - Traffic Index

### 🔒 Blockchain-style Civic Feedback
        {
     "timestamp": "2025-05-17T12:34:56",
     "feedback": "Need better drainage in sector C",
     "hash": "a7d3c9f...eaf0"
        }

- Users submit feedback, which is hashed and timestamped into a simulated blockchain ledger, ensuring transparency and immutability.

### 📊 Dashboard and Visualization
- Graphical display of:
  - Classification metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
  - Population and urban density indicators
  - Zoning recommendations
- Generates a summary image: `urban_dashboard_summary.png`

  ## 🚀 How to Run

  
  ### 1.Console Scripts
  Run the following Python scripts via terminal or an IDE:


       python "Urban upgrade.py"
       python "Final release for urban monitoring.py"
       
       # Run all cells in:
        build the future of urban intelligence.py
  ## 📌 Example Output
- Urban issues like “Slum Area” and “Flood-Prone Zones” are detected.

- Suggestions like “Build Flyover” or “Upgrade Drainage” are proposed.

- Visual dashboard is generated with metrics and indicators.

 ## 📦 Requirements
      pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn ipywidgets

  ## 🌍 Purpose
Built to explore how AI, IoT, and blockchain can be used together to improve urban planning, sustainability, and public engagement in smart cities.
